### 7.1.1 Dimensions of Globalization

Globalization encompasses several dimensions, including economic, cultural, technological, and political. These dimensions contribute to the creation of a global marketplace where businesses and consumers can interact and compete on an international scale.

#### Real-World Example

The rise of global e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Alibaba illustrates how globalization enables businesses to reach international markets and consumers to access products from around the world. These platforms facilitate cross-border trade and enhance global economic integration (Amazon, 2023; Alibaba, 2023).

### 7.1.2 Impact on Businesses

Globalization impacts businesses by expanding market opportunities, increasing competition, and driving innovation. Companies must adapt to global trends, manage cross-cultural teams, and navigate international regulations to succeed in the global marketplace.
